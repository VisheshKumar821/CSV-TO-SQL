# CSV-TO-SQL
Well, this is a normal project I made for school, actually when I was learning SQL I had to face issue while inserting new  entries on a table, I made this code to do it for you
"DOWNLOAD THE CODE AS ZIP AND PUT THE "app.py" IN YOUR DESIRED FOLDER WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR PROJECT"



Step 1: Make sure your csv file is in same directory as app.py
