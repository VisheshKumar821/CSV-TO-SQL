# CSV-TO-SQL
Well, this is a normal project I made for school, actually when I was learning SQL I had to face issue while inserting new  entries on a table, I made this code to do it for you

Step 1: Make sure you edit "database name" in app.py
Step 2: Make sure your csv file is in same directory as app.py
Step 3: Just run app.py
Step 4: Choose csv writer or sql runner (1 or 2)
Step 5: If u choosed csv write, add stuff and remember the table name will be the name of the file
Step 6: Your done !!!!!!
